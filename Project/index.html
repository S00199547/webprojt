                <p >Fashion is something we deal with everyday. Even people who say they don’t care what they wear choose clothes every morning that say a lot about them and how they feel that day.“A little of what you call frippery is very necessary towards looking like the rest of the world.”Fashion is a language which tells a story about the person who wears it. “Clothes create a wordless means of communication that we all understand,”Fashion is a means of self-expression that allows people to try on many roles in life. Whether you prefer hip-hop or Chanel-chic, fashion accommodates the chameleon in all of us. It’s a way of celebrating the diversity and variety of the world in which we live. Fashion is about change which is necessary to keep life interesting. It’s also a mirror of sorts on society. It’s a way of measuring a mood that can be useful in many aspects, culturally, socially even psychologically. At the same time, fashion shouldn’t be taken too seriously or you lose the fun of it.10 Types of Fashion Styles, Which One is You?1 Vintage Fashion Style.2 Bohemian Fashion Style.3 Chic Fashion Style.4 Artsy Fashion Style.5 Sexy Fashion Style.6 Casual Fashion Style.7 Sophisticated Fashion Style.8 Tomboy Fashion Style</p>
